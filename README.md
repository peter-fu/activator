For more information on using Activator, visit: [http://lightbend.com/activator](http://lightbend.com/activator)

Activator aims to be a friendly one-stop-shop to bootstrap your
Scala, Akka, and Play development. It can be used as a wrapper
script that launches into traditional command line
[sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Activator-Installation.html),
but it also includes a template and tutorial system, and an
optional GUI for getting started.

You can think of Activator as traditional sbt (`activator shell`
or `activator <sbt command here>`), plus an optional UI mode
(`activator ui`), plus a template system (`activator new`).

# Activator Developer Documentation

## Running the UI

    sbt> project activator-ui
    sbt> run

or just

    sbt "activator-ui/run"


## Running from the Launcher

1. Stage the distribution:

        sbt stage

2. Force the launcher to use the newly built launcher:

        rm -r ~/.activator

3. Run Activator:

        dist/target/stage/activator

### Troubleshooting

Here are some potential issues with running a local Launcher:

1. Stale cache: On it's own, `sbt stage` and `dist/target/stage/activator` should work. However, there are several caches between the developer and running `dist/target/stage/activator`. If it seems like your built version is not running, try clearing out the following caches:

    `~/.sbt/boot/[current_scala_version]/com.typesafe.activator/activator-launcher/`

    `~/.ivy2/local/com.typesafe.activator/activator-launcher/`

    `~/.ivy2/cache/com.typesafe.activator/activator-launcher/`

Also, the artifacts generated during the build process can become a problem. In your activator repo directory, you can run `git clean -X -d -f` to clear them.

## Testing

There are two types of tests:  Unit tests and integration tests.

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests, simply:

    sbt> test

To run the tests of a particular project, simply:

    sbt> <project>/test

To run a specific test, simply:

    sbt> test-only TestName

## Integration Tests

To run all the integration tests, simply:

    sbt> integrationTests

This also runs offlineTests.

## Staging a distribution

    sbt> activator-dist/stage

or just

    sbt> stage

*Note: just stage will also run `activator-ui/stage`*

Generates a distribution in the `dist/target/stage` directory.  This will use a launcher version based on the current git commit id.  To rebuild a new launcher remove your `~/.sbt/boot/scala-*/com.typesafe.activator` directory.

## Building the Distribution

Activator is versioned by either the current git tag or if there isn't a tag, the latest commit hash.  To see the current version that Activator will use for the distribution run:

    sbt show version

To create a distribution optionally create a tag and then run:

    sbt dist

This generates the file `dist/target/universal/typeasafe-activator-<VERSION>.zip`.

Activator auto-checks for new versions so to test a new unreleased version you will need to start Activator with the `-Dactivator.checkForUpdates=false` flag.  If you don't set this Activator will use the latest released version instead of the newly created one.

## Publishing the Distribution

Release overview:
 * make sure you have the desired version of the template catalog configured in `project/LocalTemplateRepo.scala`, setting is `localTemplateCacheHash`. Run `latestTemplateCacheHash` task to get latest. Can get the hash for any existing Activator fat distribution by downloading it and digging it out of the included `cache.properties` file.
 * if you're trying to ship with an old template catalog, you will need to `set LocalTemplateRepo.enableCheckTemplateCacheHash := false` temporarily before you type `publishSigned` and `s3Upload`.
 * commit the desired template catalog hash to git so your build will be reproducible.
 * if you want to make a "real" release (not a git-hash-versioned snapshot), create a git tag for it like `v1.0.2`.
 * relaunch sbt; type `show version` and it should have picked up the tag.
 * if you want to make a snapshot/test release, just let sbt use the git commit as the version. `show version` to verify.
 * be sure `test`, `integrationTests`, `offlineTests`, and `checkTemplateCacheHash` are passing.
 * `publishSigned` then `s3Upload`.
 * push the version tag to github
 * Bump the Heroku configuration for the activator servers so the latest release shows up on typesafe.com and assocaited sites.

We do both `publishSigned` and `s3Upload`. To `publishSigned` you need a GPG key.

After `publishSigned`, upload to S3.

Make sure your credentials are in an appropriate spot.  For me, that's in `~/.sbt/user.sbt` with the following content:

    credentials += Credentials("Amazon S3", "downloads.typesafe.com.s3.amazonaws.com", <AWS KEY>, <AWS PW>)

Then you can run simply:

    sbt> activator-dist/s3Upload

*OR*

    sbt> s3Upload


## Publishing NEWS to versions

First, edit the file `news/news.html` to display the news you'd like within builder.

Then run:

    sbt> news/publish-news <version>


# Issues

If you run into staleness issues with a staged release of Activator, just run `reload` in SBT to regenerate the version number and then run `stage` again.   This should give you a new stable version of SNAP for the sbt-launcher so that the new code is used.   Should only be needed when doing integration tests.
